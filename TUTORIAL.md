# First note
FreakC is a superset language which is transpiled to Batch, so pretty much all of FreakC's logic is Batch's, so it would be good if you check out the [Batch/CMD's official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands) or [a simple Batch tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/batch_script/batch_script_syntax.htm)

# Installation
There are many ways to install FreakC, you can:

1. Clone FreakC from Github using:

 		git clone https://github.com/FreakC-Foundation/FreakC.git

2. Install <a href="https://github.com/FreakC-Foundation/FreakC/releases">here</a>.

# Cli's usage
In the "FreakC" folder, open cmd and type this command to compile and run the code:

    freakc file_name
    
Example:
    
    freakc "Examples/HelloWorld.fclang"
 
If you want to compile the code only, type:

    freakc file_name --compile
    
If you want to compile the code and show the compiled code, type:

    freakc file_name --candr
    
To show the current version of the devkit, type:

    freakc --version

To create a new FreakC project quickly, you can type:

    freakc project_name --create

Notice that it will generate a file with a Hello World example in it, if you just want to create an empty file, type:

    freakc project_name --create --empty 

You can enable delayed expansion in the output with:

    freakc file_name <some-option>(create/compile/candr or nothing) --de-enabled

this would be better than `enb_delay[]` in some cases.

To keep all the .inline files and .method files, type:

    freakc --keep

To delete all stdlib files generated, type:

    freakc --clrlib

To delete all Batch files, type:

    freakc --clrbat
    
To show all options and usage, type:

    freakc --help
    
To show all options and usage with pause, type:

    freakc
    
### Interactive shell
To open interactive shell, type:

    freakc --shell
    ::Or fcshell
    
You can type in whatever you want, it will be stored in "tar.fclang". You can type in any of these commands to execute tasks:

* `start[]` - Runs all the codes written
* `endcli[]` - Delete tar.fclang and exit
* `wipe[]` - Resets codes
* `clr[]` - Clear console

# Print text
To print out a string or text, you can do it like this:

	print[] string

The command is compiled to `echo.`, if you just want to use the traditional `echo`:

	uprint[] string

It's worth noticing that `print[]` might not work well with delayed expansion, but `uprint[]` does, so try using `uprint[]` if your program starts going weird. Also, since `uprint[]` is `echo`, it should work way faster than `print[]`. But `print[]` can print out an empty line easier, so it might worth combining them in your code.

There's also `fprint[]`, which is the fastest one, but however this one doesn't work with delayed expansion variables at all.

## Store data 
You can actually store data to a file by using:

	print[] data>>file
	
	:: Overwrite:
	print[] data>file
	
	:: Multi-line
	(
	print[] data1
	print[] data2
	)>file_name

# Special characters
Unlike any characters, "!" requires "^", for example:

	::This would causes no errors
	print[] @#/
	
	::This would cause error ("!" will not be shown)
	print[] !
	
	::Correct codes:
	print[] ^!

# Unicode characters
To start using Unicode character, type:

	unicode[] >nul

So now you can use Unicode characters:

	unicode[] >nul
	print[] ă ê ©
	:: Would print out "ă ê ©"

# Prints out command's text
If you type:

	print[] print[]

It won't print out "print[]", but it will print out "echo", because FreakC will compiles any statement/command without caring if it's a used data or not. So to actually print out "print[]", you will need to add "^" in any place of the command. Example:

	print[] print[^]
	:: This will print out "print[]"

# Variables

## Variables
### String
To declare a variable, you can use:

	var[] variable_name=string_value
	
Or:

	var[] "variable_name=string_value"

Multi-line strings:

	local[] enabledelayedexpansion
	var[] multi_line_string=Line 1^
	!
	Line 2^
	!
	Line 3

With normal Batch, you don't need the `!`, you just need a blank line. But with FreakC, the compiler skips through the new lines, so what it's doing is that it force the compiler to include that line (since that line still contain a character), and because `!` is skipped, it's an equivalent to an empty line.

But that way is just outdated, you can do that in a prettier way with a built-in `LF` macro:

	var[] multi_line_string=Line 1!LF!
	Line 2!LF!
	Line 3!LF!

Though you can also use something kind of an equivalent to `\n` in other languages:

	var[] multi_line_string=Line 1!NL!Line 2!NL!Line 3

`!NL!` is a built-in macro.

You can also implement something like this:

	enb_delay[]
	var[] n=sad^
	!
	!
	print[] Hello^!n^!
	print[] World

But the `!NL!` macro is fine enough.

But note that if you're using variables, make sure to enable delayed expansion or else it won't work!

There's also a command to enable Batch-style new line macros:

	get_util[]

### Evaluate
To do math equations, do:

	eq[] equation

to store in a variable(which you should use and it's highly recommended):

	eq[] variable_name=equation

note that you can do multiple equations at once:

	eq[] variable_name1=equation1, variable_name2=equation2

also, if you want to use variables that are assigned in that exact same line, you must not use "%":

	eq[] age=1, intel=age+1
	:: Variable "intel" will have the value of 2.

A prettier alternative is `int[]`:

	int[] variable_name=equation

Note that eq[] will always round up number, to do equation or to declare a variable as a float, do:

	:: Import float
	import[] float
	float[] "variable_name" "equation"
	

### Console input
To declare a variable from user's input, try:

	inp[] variable_name=

Note: If you do this, it will prints out "Enter name:" right next to the input

	inp[] variable_name=Enter name:

To read data from a file:

	inp[] variable_name=<file_name

Multi-line:

	<file_name (
	inp[] var1=
	inp[] var2=
	)


### Arrays, lists and tuples
#### FreakC standard's naming
* List: Multiple arguments delimitted by spaces, tails or semicolons.
* Array: Variables that follow an order, which should make a collection of data.
* Tuple: A list but should only be accessed through `scan_strs[]` or `for /f`.

#### Arrays
To declare a variable as an array, use:

	var[] arr[array_index]=
	
Ex:
	
	var[] arr[0]=Hello
	var[] arr[1]=100

You should only make array start at 0, or else it might not work with prebuilt libraries.

Note that this not actually array, it's using the flexibility in naming of Batch/FreakC variables to receive the same effect.

Multi-dimensional:

	:: A 2D array
	var[] arr[0][0]=a
	var[] arr[0][1]=b
	var[] arr[1][0]=c
	var[] arr[1][1]=d

Also, keep it in mind that this is the standard way of creating arrays in FreakC in order to receive a more "defined" structure to the code, as well as to make stuffs work well with the stdlib. You can also just do something like `var[] a\1=0` then it would still work, but will not work with the stdlib.

Every time you create an array, you should create a variable that holds the length of the array (since `arr_length[]` doesn't work well if there's an empty element).

	var[] arr[0]=1
	var[] arr[1]=4
	var[] arr[2]=0
	:: You can name it whatever you like, but I would say naming it in a form like "name_len" or "name.len" is the best.
	var[] arr.len=3

If you make change to the array, be sure to update the length too since the length will matter a lot in many cases.

#### List
Creating a list:
	
	var[] list=1 2 3 4 5

Simplest way to iterate over **List**:

	var[] list=1 2 3 4 5
	scan_str[] %%i in (%list%) do (
		:: Print out every elements
		print[] %%i
	)

It's basically just like a foreach loop.

Indexing:

	scan_strs[] "tokens=<position> delims=<delimiter>" %%i in (<list>) do (
		:: Print out the element at position <position>
		print[] %%i
	)

Example:

	var[] list=1 2 3 4 5
	scan_strs[] "tokens=3 delims= " %%i in (%list%) do (
		:: Print out the element at position 3, which is 4
		print[] %%i
	)

Given that, you can have another way to iterate over a list: just create a loop from 0 to the length of the list, and use indexing like this.

List is extremely better in performance than array, and use much less memory since it doesn't create new variables, but it's not as convenient to just get a value from a specific index, and it's pretty hard to change values too. Make sure to use what serves you best.

#### Tuples

	var[] tuple=`Simon`Sawicki`
	for /F "tokens=1,2 delims=`" %%a in ("!tuple!") do (
		echo Name   : %%a
		echo Surname: %%b
	)

Technically a tuple is a list but use a different delimitter, and can not be iteratable and should be immutable as well.

### Maths 
You can do Math equations with FreakC like this:

	eq[] result=1+1+2+4

If you do this, variable "result" will be "Hel + lo"

	var[] result=Hel + lo
	
<b>Math operators</b>
<br/>
* `()                  - grouping`
* `! ~ -               - unary operators`
* `* / %               - arithmetic operators`
* `+ -                 - arithmetic operators`
* `<< >>               - logical shift`
* `&                   - bitwise and`
* `^                   - bitwise exclusive or`
* `|                   - bitwise or`
* `= *= /= %= += -=    - assignment`
* `&= ^= |= <<= >>= , - expression separator`
* `++ --               - plus/minus 1`
	
### Merge strings
To merge strings, do this:

	var[] str1=Hello
	var[] str2=World
	var[] str=%str1% %str2%

So the value of %str% is "Hello World"

Don't merge string like this:

	var[] str1=Hello
	var[] str2=World
	var[] str=%str1% + %str2%
	
This time, the value will be "Hello + World"


### Use variables in different commands
You can use variables in FreakC commands as %variable_name%

For example, to print out a variable, you can do it like this:

	var[] result=Hello World^!
	print[] %result%
	
But, to print out an element of an array, you use:

	var[] a[0]=Hello
	print[] %a[0]%
	
To print out every element of an array, you can write something like this:

	local[] ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION
	var[] a[0]=100
	var[] a[1]=35
	var[] a[2]=20
	loop[] %%n in (0,1,2) do ( 
   		print[] ^!a[%%n]^! 
	)
	
### Local and global variables
You can declare a global variable by just using all the ways mentioned recently.

To declare a variable locally, you will need to use:

	local[] 
	eq[] ans=100
	endloc[]
	
local[] and endloc[] helps create a local environment.

In Batch, to use variable in for loops, or enables command prosessor's extensions, you would need:

	setlocal ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION
	setlocal ENABLEEXTENSIONS
	
You can also do that with local[]

	local[] ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION
	local[] ENABLEEXTENSIONS

You can shorten `local[] ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION` with:

	enb_delay[]

Same with disable delayed expansion:

	dis_delay[]
	
### Delayed expansion
You have seen some `^!` above, that's an essential feature gained from delayed expansion.

If you want to prints out the element at position "i" (i is variable) of an array, you'd maybe try to do this:

	print[] %arr[%i%]%
	
But it doesn't work, because you'd need to use:

	local[] ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION
	print[] ^!arr[%i%]^!

Also, if you change a value/declare a variable in a block of code locally in a normal way, it'd often not work outside the scope, so you should use delayed expansion pretty much all the time. Example:

Suppose this code:

	if[] "%getOption%" EQU  "yes" (
		inp[] option=Enter option: 
		print[] Option read: %option%
	)

Previous code will NOT work becase %option% value is replaced just one time when the IF command is parsed (before it is executed). You need to "delay" variable value expansion until SET /P command had modified variable value:

	local[] EnableDelayedExpansion
	if "%getOption%" EQU "yes" (
		inp[] option=Enter option: 
		print[] Option read: ^!option^!
	)

This problem is taken from [this source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22278456/enable-and-disable-delayed-expansion-what-does-it-do)

Notice that you're using `local[]`, which makes all the values defined locally, so remember to always add `endloc[]` (mostly when creating a function) to ensure everything works fine, like a `return` statement for example.

	function[] getHello
		local[] enabledelayedexpansion
		:: Returning a value
		endloc[] & var[] %~1=Hello
	endfunc[]

An example of sorting an array:

	inp[] n=The amount of element:
	loop[] %%i IN (1,1,%n%) DO inp[] arr[%%i]=Element %%i:
	
	local[] enabledelayedexpansion
	loop[] %%i IN (1,1,%n%) DO (
		eq[] ind=%%i+1
		loop[] %%j IN (^!ind^!,1,%n%) DO (
			if[] ^!arr[%%i]^! GTR ^!arr[%%j]^! (
				var[] temp=^!arr[%%i]^!
				var[] arr[%%i]=^!arr[%%j]^!
				var[] arr[%%j]=^!temp^!
			)
		)
	)

	print[] Sorted:
	loop[] %%i IN (1,1,%n%) DO print[] Element %%i: ^!arr[%%i]^!

### Special variables
* %random% - A variable with the value as random numbers from 1 to 99999
* %time% - A variable with the value as the current timer
* %date% - A variable with the value as the current date
* %cd% - A variable with the value as the current directory
* %errorlevel% - A variable with the value as the current Batch errorlevel value
* %cmdextversion% - A variable with the value as the current Command Processor Extensions version number
* %cmdcmdline% - A variable with the value as the original command line that invoked the Command Processor
* %path% - A variable with the value of PATH environment variable
* %highestnumanodenumber% - A variable with the value as the highest NUMA node number on this machine

There are a lot of special variables left, but you might not find uses for them

### Some features with variables
* %variable_name:~0,-2% - would extract all but the last 2 characters of the variable
* %variable_name:~-5% - would extract the last 5 characters of the variable
* %variable_name:~5% - would remove the first 5 characters of the variable
* %variable_name:str1=str2% - would replace str1 with str2
* %PATH:~10,5% - would expand the PATH environment variable, and then use only the 5 characters that begin at the 11th (offset 10) character of the expanded result.  If the length is not specified, then it defaults to the remainder of the variable value.  If either number (offset or length) is negative, then the number used is the length of the environment variable value added to the offset or length specified

### Batch-style macro

	:: A macro which prints out "Hello"
	var[] hello= print[] Hello
	%hello%
	
You can join commands together like this:

	var[] hello= print[] Hello ^& print[] Hell yeah^!

You can also pass arguments in by doing:

	var[] macro_with_argument=for %%i in (argv) do echo %%i
	%macro_with_argument:argv=1 2 3% :: Will print out 1, 2, 3 on each new lines.

What it did is simply just repace the macro with the command (of course), and `argv` in the string has been replaced by `1 2 3` which are now the arguments.

You can also create a mutli-line macro like how I did with multi-line string from above:

	var[] macro_with_multi_commands=for %%i in (argv) do echo %%i!NL!echo Macro power %%i

This also work:

	var[] macro_with_multi_commands=for %%i in (argv) do (!LF!
		echo %%i!NL!echo Macro power %%i!LF!
	)

### FreakC's macro
The Batch-style macro is the one being replaced in runtime. While it helps the program to run faster compared to calling functions, it's still kinda slow, so here comes the FreakC's true macro which is replaced during compile time:

	:: A macro which prints out "Hello"
	define[] hello= print[] Hello
	!hello!

Remember that macros which acts like commands "kinda" require a " " in the back, but a normal macro doesn't:

	define[] key=124123
	print[] The key is !key!

FreakC's macro still works just like normal Batch variables, so you can also do stuffs like replace strings, generate substrings,...

	define[] key=124123
	print[] The key is !key:~1,2!
	:: The result will be "The key is 24"

Basically, it should work like normal Batch's variables. But currently, multi-line macro doesn't work :(

### Alternative to macro
If you want an alternative, try reading at the [#Function] section. There will be docs about inlined functions, which are as fast as macros, but as nice as normal functions.

So why macro if inlined function is better? Well, simple, just don't use macro for any function-like stuffs, but macros can be good for stuffs like shorter naming, or really small tasks that usually just come as a form a single command :v

### Notes
Also, spaces in FreakC is extremely important, so if you declare a variable like this:

	eq[] abc = 100

It will declare the "abc " variable, so if you prints it out like this, it will not work

	print[] %abc%
	
You will have to code like this:

	print[] %abc %
	
Then, it will prints out " 100"

Other thing that you should notice is that 

	var[] text
	
would return any variable begins with "text"

# Comments
## The best way

	!= This is a comment =!

Because an undefined macro returns nothing, all the stuffs inside is gone in the compiler nicely. And because there are no variables named `= varname =`, we can use it safely. It's also the fastest one, since it's removed in compile time lol.

## Batch's way
Single-line Batch comment:

	:: Comment

This might break in Batch's parenthesized block, but it's the fastest one.

Another way:

	rem comment
	
This is the slowest one.

Another way:

	%=  =%

Its performance is decent, and work all the time.

## Old dumb way
Multi-line comment that's transpiled to Batch comments:

	c[] line1
	line2
	e[]

To write a comment that won't show up in the compiled codes, use:

	h[] comment
	
Multi-line version:

	ch[] comment1
	comment2
	ce[]

# Labels and Goto statement
Labels helps you to jump to a state or pass parameters to execute tasks (somewhat procedural programming).

To create a label/procedure, you use:

	label[] label_name

To jump to a label, you use:

	goto[] label_name

To call a label/procedure, you use:

	call[] :label_name

Or:

	lcall[] label_name

call[] can also targets file, while lcall[] can only targets label. For example, you can execute files like this:

	call[] file_name

### Differences between goto[] and call[]
goto[] jumps to a label and will not execute the previous code while call[] use code from the label but still execute the previous code.

Also, goto[] also supports parameters, which helps you a lot of time.

For examples, this code will print the sum of two parameters:

	goto[] :plus 1 2
	label[] plus
	eq[] ans=%~1 + %~2
	print[] %ans%

Note: You can pass arguments in FreakC are %~1, %~2,...

### Notes
To restart the program, you can type:

	goto[] FreakCCompiled

It is because the compiled code of FreakC is in a main label/procedure "FreakCCompiled"

This code would still work eventhough it contains special character

	label[] dsasd$ 123213 323
	goto[] dsasd$ 123213 323

## Shorter call statement
You can replace

	call[] function_name "arg1" "arg2"

with

	function_name[..] "arg1" "arg2"
	
There's also one for calling labels:

	label_name[::] "arg1" "arg2"
	
# Function
## Function definition using `label[]`

	:: main code goes here
	:: Calling the function
	lcall[] function_name
	:: function_name[::]
	end[]
	
	label[] function_name
		:: function's code goes here
	end[]

## Define function by creating a new Batch file
You can create a new file and call it manually, or you can use:

	function[] function_name
		:: Code goes here
	endfunc[]

Example:

	function[] SayHello
		print[] Hello
		:: Using the arguments
		print[] %~1
		:: Safely exit the function
		:: end[]
	endfunc[]
	:: Prints "Hello"
	call[] SayHello
	:: SayHello[..]

The upper code creates a file called "SayHello.bat" and just calls it.

This also works:

	(
	print[] print[] Hello
	print[] :: Using the arguments
	print[] print[] %~1
	print[] :: Safely exit the function
	print[] :: end[]
	)>SayHello.bat
	:: Prints "Hello"
	call[] SayHello
	:: SayHello[..]

So what's the difference? `function[]` is processed in compile time, but storing into the file manually is executed during runtime, so it's much faster and more convenient to just use `function[]`.

For some cases, you should add:

	end[]

to properly exit the function. But technically, the function should works fine most of the time with out `end[]`.

## Differences between labels and files
By using `function[]`, you are actually creating a new Batch file, but by using `label[]`, it's just calling a label, so it grants more speed. But by using `label[]`, the function will be defined locally in that specific file, while `function[]` generates a whole new file, so it can be accessed by other files with the given path.

For example, you have a `Main.fclang` file:

	function[] SayHello
		print[] Hello
	endfunc[]

and a folder named 'stuffs' at the same scope, with `stuffs.fclang` in it:

	:: You can call "SayHello" like this:
	call[] ../SayHello.bat

Both ways are fine, `label[]`'s speed is bad when the main file's too large, `function[]`'s speed is bad when the user's drive has a lot of latency. If you want your code to be more structured, you should probably go with labels, but FreakC's mainly used for scripting, not something too big so both, again, are fine.

Note that with both labels and `function[]`(files), you should use `local[]` and `endloc[]` to define the variables locally, So you can do something like this:

	function[] hello
		local[]
		var[] sth=hello
		:: End local environment and return a value
		endloc[] & var[] %~1=%sth%
	endfunc[]

## Return statement
Functions in FreakC are accessed through the call statement, so it's not an expression, so you can "return" a value by assigning value to selected variable.

Example:

	function[] sum
		eq[] %~1=%~2+%~3
 	endfunc[]
	
	:: Variable "sum" will be granted the value "3"
	call[] sum "result" "1" "2"
	:: sum[..] "result" "1" "2"
	
	:: Prints out 3
	print[] %result%
	
## Recursion
You can implement recursion by simply calling the function inside of it. For example, this is a program which will prints a string for "n" times:

	function[] printLoop
		print[] %~1
		eq[] n=%~2-1
		call printLoop "%~1" "%n%"
	endfunc[]

Note that using `call` will give you a recursion limit of about 339. To fix this problem you can use `cmd /c`, or just implement a goto command to exit the function, store the current state in a variable and call it again, that should give you infinite recursion limit.

## Performance issues
Both using labels and `function[]` are fairly slow, if you want to improve performance, just use a normal Batch macro since it's much faster.

## Inline function
To boost the speed up, I **highly suggest** using inlined functions. It's as fast as macros, and works just like normal functions :D

	inlinef[] somefunc
		:: Arg1
		print[] 1[]
		:: Arg2
		print[] 2[]
	endfunc[]
	
	somefunc[//] arg1 arg2
	:: icall[] somefunc arg1 arg2

However, there's currently a severe limitation: inline funtions can't be used with delayed expansion variables, it can only work with normal values and normal variables. I'll work hard to fix this problem soon!

# Object Oriented Programming
## Objects
Note that there are no such things as "objects" in FreakC/Batch, but you can use the FreakC variable to gain the same effect as seen in other languages:

	var[] dog.name=Mary
	var[] dog.age=3
	function[] dog.move
		print[] *Moving*
	endfunc[]
	
Or you may have it like this (technically you can do it however you want because of how FreakC's variables work):

	var[] dog["name"]=Mary
	var[] dog["age"]=3
	function[] dog["move"]
		print[] *Moving*
	endfunc[]

You can access the elements normally:

	enb_delay[]
	
	print[] %dog.age%
	
	:: An example with getting an element from input
	inp[] input=
	print[] ^!dog.%input%^!
	:: If the input is "name" then the output will be "Mary"

## Classes
You can implement a "class" like this:

	:: Create a class called "Dog"
	class[] Dog
		:: Init method
		method[] init
			::Set properties, implementing "this" as the first argurment passed (%~1)
			var[] %~1.age=%~2
			var[] %~1.weight=%~3
		endmethod[]
		
		method[] BeingCute
			print[] *Being cute*
		endmethod[]
	endclass[]
	
	:: Create an object
	new[] Dog "Mary" "3" "4kg"
	:: Prints out "age" property of "Mary", which is "3"
	print[] Age: %Mary.age%
	:: Call "Mary.BeingCute", which prints out "*Being cute*"
	call[] Mary.BeingCute

## Old crappy function-based oop
You can implement a "class" like this:

	:: Create a procedure called "Dog"
	function[] Dog
		::Set properties, implementing "this" as the first argurment passed (%~1)
		var[] $this.age=%~2
		var[] $this.weight=%~3
		:: Storing the codes inside a Batch file, which creates something like a method
		(
			print[] print[] *Being cute*
		)>%~1.BeingCute.bat
	endfunc[]

	:: Create an object
	Dog[..] "Mary" "3" "4kg"
	:: Prints out "age" property of "Mary", which is "3"
	print[] Age: %Mary.age%
	:: Call "Mary.BeingCute", which prints out "*Being cute*"
	call[] Mary.BeingCute

## Class-based or function-based OOP?
Just use classes, don't use functions, function is the old way. Classes are much more readable, and they are in fact faster, since the methods are generated in compile time, while in the function's way, it is generated in runtime, and creating/writing to files in runtime is **incredibly slow**.

## Inhertitance and polymorphism
### The new way: 

	extends[] parent_class

### What will it do?
It will inherit all the methods from the parent class. Since there are no actual properties in FreakC's classes, it will simply copy the init function from the parent class and paste it in the one in the child class (if the child class has an init function lol). So technically you can say classes in FreakC are just things that create collections of methods.

### The old way:
The old function way: You can create an init function and call it inside the "classes"(functions) you're creating.

## Encapsulation
With encapsulation, you can implement getter/setter functions to implement protected, everytime the data got accessed it must go through a getter/setter function. With private, you do the same thing as protected, however, rather than putting it inside the init function, only add it in one specific "class"(function).

Keep it in mind that there have been many attempts implementing OOP in Batch, the upper one is just my way to do it in FreakC.

# If statements
To use if statement, check this out:

	if[] condition command_to_execute
	
Example:

	var[] abc=100
	if[] %abc% == 100 (
		print[] abc is equal to 100
	)
	
	:: With strings
	var[] str=Hello
	if[] "%str%" == "Hello" (
		print[] Hello there
	)

It's actually a good practice to have the values in the comparison quoted.
 	
You can actually use a Batch command in if[]. Example:

	var[] abc=20
	if[] %abc% == 20 (
		echo abc is equal to 100
	)
	
## All the comparison operators:
* "==" - Equal
* "EQU" - Equal/numeric equal
* "NEQ" - Not equal
* "LSS" - Less than
* "LEQ" - Less than or equal
* "GTE" - Greater than
* "GEQ" - Greater than or equal

## Conditional expression
There are no actual "conditional expression" in FreakC, but here's something close to a "ternary operator":

	cnd[] var_name "condition" "value1" "value2"

Example:

	cnd[] result "1 EQU 2" "1 is equal to 2" "1 is not equal to 2"
	print[] %result% :: Will print out "1 is not equal to 2"

## Other kinds or if statements:

### Execute if a file exists

	if_exist[] file_name (
		command_to_execute
	)
	
### Execute if a variable is defined

	if_defined[] variable_name (
		command_to_execute
	)
	
### Execute if a condition is false

	if_not[] condtition (
		command_to_execute
	)

### Else

	if[] condition (
		command1
	) elif[] condition2 (
		command2
	) el[] (
		command3
	)

## Notes
To use if not for if_defined[] or if_exist[], you can do this:

	if_not_exist[] file (
		command_to_execute
	)
	if_not_defined[] file (
		command_to_execute
	)
	
## Pressing keys with respond
To receive keys pressed, add:

	key[] key
	
For examples, if you want the users to press one in "wsad", type:

	key[] wsad

To perform any actions, you will need to use a special if statement:

	if_el[] position_of_key_in_key[]

Note: actually, `if_el` gets the errorlevel variable's value.

Example:

	key[] wsad
	if_el[] 4 (
		print[] You pressed "D"
	)
	if_el[] 3 (
		print[] You pressed "A"
	)
	if_el[] 2 (
		print[] You pressed "S"
	)
	if_el[] 1 (
		print[] You pressed "W"
	) 

### If not errorlevel
You can use:

	if_not_el[]
	
to use if not.

# Switch case
If you're familiar with C, then this is FreakC's way on how to use a switch case:

	enb_delay[]
	match[] value
		case[] value1
		:: Code
		endcase[]
		case[] value2
		:: Code
		endcase[]
		default[]
		:: Code executed when no case is match, and this block is optional
		endcase[]
	endmatch[]

But currently there's limitations with this command, as it currently can't check multiple cases :/, will update the feature soon!!

# Loops

## For loops (in Batch)

### Loops from "start" to "end" by "step"

	loop[] %%parameters in (start,step,end) do (
	)
	
### Loops through files rooted in a folder

	scan_dir[] drive/directory %%parameters in (file) do (
	)
	
### Loops through files, strings, or even the returned result of a command

	scan_strs[] "tokens=position-position delims=delimiter" %%parameters in (something) do (	
	)

If `something` is double-quoted, then it is a string.
If `something` is single-quoted, then it is a command to be executed, and the parameter will be the returned content of the command.
If `something` is not quoted, then it will loops through every lines in a file.
`tokens` are the tokens you want to take, set it to a number if you want to get the token at that position set it to `*` if you want to get all tokens, set it to `number1-number2` if you want to get the tokens start from position number1 to position number2, and to access those tokens, use paratemeters in alphabetical order.
	
### Loops through a set of parameters

	scan_str[] %%parameters in (set) do (
	)
	
### Loops through a folder

	scan_files[] %%parameters in (folder) do (
	)
	
## While loops
While loops can be created using:

	while[] condition
	::code
	endwhile[]

Of course, the loops will run when the condition is still true, stop when false.

### Repeat-until loop

	repeat[]
	::code
	until[] condition

### Differences between While and Repeat Until
While loop is executed only when given condition is true. While repeat-until executes the codes first before caring about the condition, and it loops until the condition is true.

### Nesting while loops
This will work just fine:

	while[] condition
		while[] condition
		endwhile[]
	endwhile[]

<b>(Same with repeat-until)</b>

## Batch's way to create whiles loops.
FreakC's while loops are compiled down to goto statements and labels, so you can also create a while loop using normal Batch:

	eq[] i=start_number
	label[] loop
	command
	if[] %i% == end_number goto[] nextcode
	eq[] i++
	goto[] loop
	
	label[] nextcode
	command

But this would be too bulky, just stick with FreakC's whilee loop.
	
For example, this program will print all the number from 0 to 10 then print out "Done!":

	eq[] i=0
	label[] loop
	print[] %i%
	if[] %i% == 10 goto[] nextcode
	eq[] i++
	goto[] loop
	
	label[] nextcode
	print[] Done^!

## FreakC's for loop

	enb_delay[]
	for[] var_name start step end
		:: some code
	endfor[]

Why? Because FreakC's while loops are compiled down to labels and goto statements, which means that Batch's for will not work well with FreakC's while, unless you create a function containing that while loop, and then call it inside the Batch-style's for loop, then it would work, but that's tedious. However, FreakC's for loop is compiled down to the same format as while loops, so you can nest while and for loops together easily. Also, by using FreakC's for loop, you can gain some features which I will cover in the next section.

But there's some drawbacks, the biggest one is probably performance loss because FreakC's for is compiled down to goto statments and labels, which are way slower than Batch-styl for loops. But if you prefer convenience to performance then `for[]` is good for you, same with macros and functions lol.

## Break, continue statement
To break out a FreakC's for loop or while loop, simply use `breakl[]`:

	enb_delay[]
	for[] i 0 1 5
		if[] ^!i^! == 3 breakl[]
	endfor[]
	:: This will print out 1, 2

To skip one iteration, use `continue[]`:

	enb_delay[]
	for[] i 0 1 5
		if[] ^!i^! == 3 continue[]
	endfor[]
	:: This will print out 1, 2, 4

`continue[]` and `breakl[]` can work well with while loops and repeat-until loops.

# Inlining commands
Note that all commands can be inlined normally, except all FreakC-exclusive commands that uses its own kind of block statement.
These includes:
* `function[]` - `endfunc[]`
* `while[]` - `endwhile[]`
* `repeat[]` - `until[]`
* `match[]` - `endmatch[]`
* `case[]` - `endcase[]`


This will not work

	function[] something endfunc[]

or this:

	if[] 1 == 1 while[] 1 > 0
		print[] OMG
	endwhile[]

it should have been:

	if[] 1 == 1 (
		while 1 > 0
			print[] OMG
		endwhile[]
	)

# Asynchronous process
In Batch, you can run a Batch file asynchronously using:

	start /B "" file.bat
	
the equivalent in FreakC would be:

	open[] /B "" file.bat

Example with functions:

	enb_delay[]

	:: asynchronous code
	open[] /b "" count[..] "Dog"
	:: synchronous code
	count[..] "Sheep"

	:: Count function to print a string 10 times
	function[] count
		@echo off
		loop[] %%i in (1 1 10) do (
			print[] %%i %~1
			wait[] 2 >nul
		)
	endfunc[]

You would be able to see that it doesn't wait for 2 seconds to print out Dog and *then* Sheep, Dog and Sheep are printed at almost the same time. This is because the code is run asynchronously, it is non blocking. This helps a lot in improving performance because you can technically change "in-order" tasks into tasks that run together. Think of it as a bathtub, rather than making one people take a bath and then proceeds to the next one, you can just put all people into the bathtub, which should reduce a lot of time, and should scale well if given more people (who in real case, are users). Or if you are developing a videogame, the code can reacts to user's input while the game is still rendering normally.

# Parentheses
## An alternative
Because FreakC uses more "human-friendly" syntax, but Batch uses parentheses for creating blocks of codes, so I've decided to add a crappy "human version" of this:

	if[] 1 == 1 begin[]
		while 1 > 0
			print[] OMG
		endwhile[]
	done[]

`begin[]` and `done[]` are direct equivalents of `(` and `)`, so they both work the same, but if you prefer codes to be more "human-readable", then this would be pretty good.

# Escaping characters
## Escaping special characters
To escape characters like `&|><` and most other characters, you can use the caret character:

	:: Prints out "&"
	print[] ^&
	:: Prints out "|"
	print[] ^|

### Escaping the caret character itself

	print[] ^^

## Escaping % and !
With `%`, you can just double it up to escape it. Example:

	:: Will print out "%LOL%"
	print[] %%LOL%%

If you use `!` not for variables, then one caret character will do the job:

	:: Will print out "Hello!"
	print[] Hello^!
	
With `!` for variables, you can add 5 caret characters:

	:: Will print out "!Hello!"
	var[] hello=hello freakc
	print[] ^^^^^!hello^^^^^!

## Escaping quotation marks
If you pass in arguments for functions (or for loops) like this:

	func_name[..] "Arg1" "Arg2" "Arg3 "  "

then there would be errors.

Instead, you must double the quotes:

	func_name[..] "Arg1" "Arg2" "Arg3 ""  "

Then just replace 2 quotes with one.

# Modules and include
Create a module:

	deny[]
	:: code goes here

Include the compiled content of the module:

	include[] file_with_no_fclang_extension

`include[]` gives you the same effect you would get from `#include` from C/C++, but there're some differences. #include takes the code of the other file and put it in the main file and then the main file is compiled, while include[] compiles the other file first and then take that compiled codes and put it in the compiled main file.

You can also compile a file without including it:

	compile[] file_with_no_fclang_extension

This might come in handy if you have files as functions. (Batch style)

# Pre-built libraries
## Float

	float[] "variable_name" "some_value"

## List

	:: Find sum of list of numbers, seperated by a space character.
	sum[] "variable_name" "list"
	
	:: Find maximum of list, seperated by a space character.
	max[] "variable_name" "list"
	
	:: Find minimum of list, seperated by a space character.
	min[] "variable_name" "list"
	
	:: Example:
	max[] "max_num" "2 3 1 8 5"
	:: This will prints out "8"
	print[] %max_num%

## Array

	:: Find sum of every elements in an array
	arr_sum[] "variable_name" "array" "length"
	
	:: Find largest element in an array
	arr_max[] "variable_name" "array" "length"
	
	:: Find smallest element in an array
	arr_min[] "variable_name" "array" "length"
	
	:: Return true if array include a value, false if not
	arr_includes[] "variable_name" "value" "array" "length"
	
	:: Find first index of an element, return -1 if find none
	arr_indexOf[] "variable_name" "value" "array" "length"
	
	:: Find last index of an element, return -1 if find none
	arr_lastIndexOf[] "variable_name" "value" "array" "length"
	
	:: Return a value which concatenated all elements in an array
	arr_join[] "variable_name" "array" "length"
	
	:: Find length of an array (will crash if an element is empty)
	arr_length[] "variable_name" "array"
	
	:: Reverse array
	arr_reverse[] "array" "length"
	
	:: Append a value into an array
	arr_push[] "array" "value" "length"
	:: But this is not really a good way to append a value into an array, you can just do this and it's way better:
	var[] array[length+1]=value
	:: By doing this, you gain better performance, and you can have better control at the array's length:
	:: Example:
	int[] arr_len++
	var[] arr[%len%]=5
	
	:: Prepend a value into an array (requires delayed expansion being enabled) 
	arr_unshift[] "array" "value" "length"
	
	:: Remove the last value from an array 
	arr_pop[] "array" "length"
	:: Same with arr_push[], this function is not really good, this is a better way:
	var[] array[length]=
	:: Example:
	var[] arr[%arr_len%]=
	int[] arr_len--
	
	:: Remove the first value from an array (requires delayed expansion being enabled) 
	arr_shift[] "array" "length"
	
	:: Remove an "amount" value from a specified "index" from "array" 
	arr_splice[] "array" "index" "amount"
	
	:: Fill the array from index1 to index2 with a value
	arr_fill[] "array" "value" "index1" "index2"
	:: Come to think of it, you can create a whole new array filled with some value using arr_fill with out declaration
	
	:: Sort an array using the quick sort algorithm
	arr_qsort[] "array" "low" "high"
	
	:: Clear an array (will crash if an element is empty)
	arr_clear[] "array" "length"


	:: Example:
	var[] arr[0]=1
	var[] arr[1]=0
	var[] arr[2]=10
	arr_max[] "max_num" "arr" "3"
	:: This will print out "10"
	print[] %max_num%

### Note
All the functions above only works with list with all integers. String or floats will cause errors.
	
## Math

	:: Absolute
	abs[] "variable_name" "number"
	
	:: Check if a number is odd
	odd[] "variable_name" "number"

	:: Check if a number is even
	even[] "variable_name" "number

	:: Power
	pow[] "variable_name" "number" "power_num"
	
	:: Factorial
	factorial[] "variable_name" "number"
	
## String

	:: Length of string
	string_length[] "variable_name" "string"
	
	:: To uppercase
	string_upper[] "variable_name" "string"
	
	:: To lowercase
	string_lower[] "variable_name" "string"
	
	:: Reverse
	string_reverse[] "variable_name" "string"
	
	:: First first index of a substring in a string
	string_indexOf[] "variable_name" "substring" "string"
	
	:: First last index of a substring in a string
	string_lastIndexOf[] "variable_name" "substring" "string"
	
	:: Trim all excess spaces from both side of a string
	string_trim[] "variable_name" "string"
	
	:: Return true if string starts with a substring, false if it doesn't
	string_startswith[] "variable_name" "string" "substring" "position"
	
	:: Return true if string ends with a substring, false if it doesn't
	string_endswith[] "variable_name" "string" "substring" "position"
	
	:: Return an ASCII value equivalent to the character, if passed a string, it will return the value of the first character only, so if you pass in """" it will give you the ASCII value of the double quote character
	string_ord[] "variable_name" "value"
	
	:: Return a character equivalent to its ascii value
	string_chr[] "variable_name" "value"
	:: Note that you would probably need a caret character for escaping some special characters like "<>&^" like this:
	string_chr[] "variable_name" "value"
	print[] ^%variable_name% :: This is safe and highly recommended

	
## Import keyword and generating methods
From v0.6.1, `import[]` has been obsolete since commands can generate their own independent method files. But you can still use it if you want, it will generate a bunch of files even when you don't need them though:

	:: Will generate all method files for math
	import[] math

But I guess if you want to call files normally, you can use import for that:

	import[] math
	fclib_math_pow[..] "some_var" "some_value"

But you can use `gen_lib_func[]` which is much cleaner, and only generates the needed method:

	gen_lib_func[]
	fclib_math_pow[..] "some_var" "some_value"

But for real, why would you need to do that, just type in `pow[] "some_var" "some_value"`. It's shorter and it's basically the same thing.
	
# Command-line argument
You can use %1, %2, %3,... for command-line args

For example, you have a FreakC file called "main" like this (which will be compiled later):

	print[] First argument: %1
	print[] Second argument: %2
	print[] Third argument: %3

If you pass in the file with these arguments:

	./main Hello World and FreakC
	
Then the output would be:

	First argument: Hello
	Second argument: World
	Third argument: and

# Statement
It's important to say that pretty much everything is a statement, not an expression. Every commands are executed, and no values are returned at all.

# Error handling
First of all, you'll need to know that the FreakC compiler will not catches errors at all, but you can still receive errors from CMD or the Batch interpreter.

## Error handling
You can catch errors by using the following codes:

	command && (
		echo The codes ran successfully
	) || (
		echo Failed :(
	)
	
By using the "and" and "or" operator, we can implement error handling like above. Basically, it runs the "command", if there's no problem, it will execute the first block, or else it will execute the other block.

# Nul in FreakC
It's just like nul in Batch, so if you want to make your console not print out any process, you can do it like this:

	Command >nul
	
To hide errors, you can do this:

	Command >nul 2>nul

# Find strings in a file 
fnd[]:

	/N         Displays line numbers with the displayed lines.
	/I         Ignores the case of characters when searching for the string.
	/OFF[LINE] Do not skip files with offline attribute set.
	"string"   Specifies the text string to find.
	[drive:][path]filename Specifies a file or files to search.
	
	If a path is not specified, FIND searches the text typed at the prompt or piped from another command.

	/B         Matches pattern if at the beginning of a line.
	/E         Matches pattern if at the end of a line.
	/L         Uses search strings literally.
	/R         Uses search strings as regular expressions.
	/S         Searches for matching files in the current directory and all subdirectories.
	/I         Specifies that the search is not to be case-sensitive.
	/X         Prints lines that match exactly.
	/V         Prints only lines that do not contain a match.
	/N         Prints the line number before each line that matches. 
	/M         Prints only the filename if a file contains a match.
	/O         Prints character offset before each matching line.
	/P         Skip files with non-printable characters.
	/OFF[LINE] Do not skip files with offline attribute set.
	/A:attr    Specifies color attribute with two hex digits. See "color /?"
	/F:file    Reads file list from the specified file(/ stands for console).
	/C:string  Uses specified string as a literal search string.

	/D:dir     Search a semicolon delimited list of directories
	strings    Text to be searched for.
	[drive:][path]filename Specifies a file or files to search.
	
	Use spaces to separate multiple search strings unless the argument is prefixed with /C.  
	For example, 'FINDSTR "hello there" x.y' searches for "hello" or "there" in file x.y.  
	'FINDSTR /C:"hello there" x.y' searches for "hello there" in file x.y.
	
	Regular expression quick reference:
	.        Wildcard: any character
	*        Repeat: zero or more occurrences of previous character or class
	^        Line position: beginning of line
	$        Line position: end of line
	[class]  Character class: any one character in set
	[^class] Inverse class: any one character not in set
	[x-y]    Range: any characters within the specified range

# Clear codes
You can clear all compiled code using:

	deny[]
	
# Multiple colors
Since everything works fine in Batch works in FreakC, you can check this out: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mlocati/fdabcaeb8071d5c75a2d51712db24011/raw/b710612d6320df7e146508094e84b92b34c77d48/win10colors.cmd

# Convert FreakC to .EXE files
In "FreakC/Utilities/Scripts" there is a file called battoexe.bat which helps to convert .bat files to .exe files.

So to convert FreakC to .EXE files, you need to compile FreakC codes to Batch, and then convert the Batch file generated by simply dragging that Batch file onto battoexe.bat.

You can actually find plenty of other tools online that helps you to converts Batch files to EXE files.

# Notes
FreakC is case-sensitive only with commands with [], other stuffs aren't.

Most of the commands are just modified Batch commands, so you can actually apply Batch logic in it.

Funny fact, you can print "Hello, World" using:

	hello_world[]
